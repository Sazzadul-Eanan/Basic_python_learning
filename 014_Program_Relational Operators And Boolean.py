# Relational operators and boolean data type-

     # There are two boolean expressions - 'True' and 'False'

# (Comparison by relational operators gives boolean expressions)

print(30>20)    # greater than
print(30<20)    # less than
print(30>=20)   # greater than or equal to (If only one relation is true, the boolean will be true)
print(30<=20)   # less than or equal to
print(30==20)   # equal  (Note that, in python a=b means 'b' is stored in 'a')
print(30!=20)   # not equal
print("FAHIM"=="FAHIM")
