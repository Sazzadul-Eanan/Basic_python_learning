# Use of 'while-loop' for printing consecutive numbers


                     # Three compulsory components of a 'while-loop'-

i = 1                # Initialization
while i <= 20 :      # Conditions
    print(i)
    i = i + 1        # Update

# Notice that the 'print()' is typed above the 'update' here, because every times the 'print()' is done with printing a number, the 'update' then again starts working on the next number of the order to be printed; which continues untill the 'condition' is meet.
