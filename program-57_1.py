# In Python functions are 'groups of related statements' that can be called together, that typically perform a specific task, and which may or may not take a set of parameters or return a value.

# Functios allow you to assign a name to a 'code block' that performs a concrete computation. These named code blocks can be reused quickly because you can use their name to call them from different places in your code.

# Basic elements of a 'user defined' function


def print_msg():              # name of the function 'print_msg()'      # caller code
 print('Hello World!')        # Statement to execute      # also known as body of the function

print_msg()                   # calling the function      # A function call consists of the functionâ€™s name
