# Magic Methods : in Python are the special methods that START and END with the 'double underscores'
# Also known as Dunder Methods
# Magic methods are not invoked DIRECTLY, but the invocation happens INTERNALLY from the class on a certain action

# __init__()  To get an object automatically being called by a method without the relevant method being explicitly called by the object

# Some magic methods for comparison and their meaning -

# __gt__()  use for 'greater than' (>)
# __eq__()  use for 'equal' (=)
# __ne__()  use for 'not equal' (!=)
# __le__()  use for 'less than equal' (<=)
# __ge__()  use for 'greater than equal' (>=)

# Some magic methods for arithmatic operation -
